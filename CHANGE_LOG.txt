  allegro_hand_ros



12/11/2013:
- It is now possible to run multiple Allegro Hands on the same roscore. Due to nodes and topics being launched with the same names, this was not possible before. Nodes and topics can now be enumerated.
When launching an Allegro Hand controller using "allegro_hand.launch" (or the other hardware launchers), you should now specify the hand number, "NUM", and the CAN channel, "CAN_CH" .

  roslaunch allegro_hand.launch HAND:=right ZEROS:=parameters/zero0.yaml NUM:=0 CAN_CH:=/dev/pcan0 
  roslaunch allegro_hand.launch HAND:=left  ZEROS:=parameters/zero1.yaml NUM:=1 CAN_CH:=/dev/pcan1
  
"NUM"    default = 0
"CAN_CH" default = /dev/pcan32

- "allegro_hand_joint_gui" now runs using the "-core_pd" controller by default. You can tune the gains in the parameters/gains_pd.yaml file. You can still input the arg "CONTROLLER" to change which controller is used. The keyboard handl;er is disabled by default now.
- Allegro Hand nodes now specify whether they are running on a left or right hand. This can most easily be seen in the ROS node/topic graph.

Known Issues:
- While all parameters defining the hand's motor/encoder directions and offsets fall under the enumerated "allegroHand_#" namespaces, the parameter "robot_description" definining the kinematic structure and joint limits remains global. When launching a second hand, this parameter is overwritten. I have yet to find a way to have a seperate enumerated "robot_decription" parameter for each hand. If you have any info on this, please advise.
** This issue seems to cause no problems other than preventing access to previous "robot_description" files after another hand is launched.





12/10/2013:
- The inclusion of which_hand in the zero.yaml file has been deprecated. Which hand (left/right) must now be specified as an argument when launching the Allegro Hand as an input for both the
- HAND library interfaces updated to fix left/right controller initialization bug. Left hand's pinching and grasping algorithms should now work correctly. robot_description and for the grasping library controllers.
- Offsets, etc. parameter file path argument added to all actual-hardware launch files. Default path is "parameters/zero.yaml"
- CAN Channel ROS argument has been added to all actual-hardware launch files. Default channel is "/dev/pcan32".
- Geometric issues on left hand URDF corrected.
